# Docker
# Defination
Docker is a s/w platform  that allows us to build ,test and deploy application quickly,docker packages s/w into standardized units called conatiners
docker can help us in easy deployment and scaling.


# docker file
The file having all the code, configuration,etc. that file is called as docker file.
- build command is used to convert the docker-file into docker-image.
- to get image from docker hub we need to write a command called `docker pull image-name`
- to run a particular image in a docker we need to write a command `docker run image-id` or `docker run image-name`
# docker image
It is a built form of docker-file and it is sharable.
# docker-container
docker running image called as container.
# Monolith vs Micro-Service architecture
Monolith :- Tightly coupled(to much dependency)
- Not so good at fault tolerance.
- Difficult to scale.
- Less modularity.
- Less complexity.
- Can be built at lower cost.
Micro-services:-
- Lossly coupled(less dependency)
- Good at fault-tolerance.
- Easy to scale.
- High modularity.
- High complexity.
- High cost.
